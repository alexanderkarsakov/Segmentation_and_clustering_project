# Segmentation and clustering project

In this project we will do a customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning (clustering). We will create subsets based on the demographics, perform exploratory data analysis to understand our data. Then we will use a k-means clustering algorithm to create our segments. Our target group is a cluster 1 which has a high spending score and high income. We should find different methods to attract these buyers using a targeting marketing campaign. Cluster 2 provides opportunities to the customers to buy popular goods. The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers.
